                lucid lab encourages curious thinkers to explore, learn and challenge our collective understandings of AI. Our aim is for readers to leave with a unique appreciation of the histories, philosophies, and stories that shape AI technologies. We seek to make
                these ideas accessible, and in particular, to encourage young women to engage in a field that is sustained by exclusionary power structures.

                Inspired by Sister Corita Kentâ€™s Immaculate Heart College Art Department Rules, at Lucid Lab we consider everything an experiment â€“ this is a place for us to expand on ideas that fascinate us; a place for our ideas and research to evolve.

                <p>
                    Jennifer is a student on the MSt in AI Ethics and Society course at Cambridge. Born and raised in Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°, her research interests lie in the comparative geopolitics of AIâ€” particularly between China, the UK and the US. Her previous works investigated
                    the threats of AI on civil liberties and the political economy of AI. She engages with the Effective Altruism movement and is figuring out how she can make an impact in the field of AI governnace. She is excited to use Lucid Lab to
                    reconnect with her love of writing and experiment with different topics and writing styles.

                    My name is pronounced Deyâ€“ana. Iâ€™m an interdisciplinary designer and student on the MSt in AI Ethics and Society at the University of Cambridge. I create films, visual essays and experiences with machine learning; either to promote mental wellâ€“being or
                    to provoke critical discourse. I mostly like to interrogate soâ€“called â€˜emotion recognitionâ€™ systems, although currently Iâ€™m interrogating the role of NLPs in social media. Lucid Lab is a place to explore and evolve my fascination with
                    modern science, disenchantment and occultism through writing. And anything else that draws me down a rabbit hole. Currently reading: David Graeberâ€™s The Utopia of Rules.
